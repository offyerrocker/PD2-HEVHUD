NOTE ABOUT SETTINGS:
The "hevhud_vars.ini" file found in the main HEVHUD folder is a template that contains many advanced settings too numerous or complex to create user-accessible menu options. To use this, COPY the "hevhud_vars.ini" file into your "mods/saves/" folder, then EDIT THAT COPY. 
DO NOT EDIT THE COPY IN THE HEVHUD FOLDER, because your changes to that file will be lost whenever you update HEVHUD.
